This "AdptArray.c" file is part of the ADT assignment.

I added the AdptArray.c file to the given ones. 

In the AdptArray.c file We define the structure of the array,
and in addition all the functions required to manage it.

In order to create the current file I took help from:
a. My solution to the test that was in systems programming A. 
b. The solution published on the course website
